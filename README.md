# Retail Sales Analysis

This project analyzes retail sales data to gain insights into various aspects such as overall sales trend, sales by product category, purchases by gender, age distribution of customers, and provides sales forecasting using ARIMA models. Additionally, correlations between certain features and total sales are examined.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about retail sales including dates, product categories, gender of customers, age, quantity, price per unit, and total amount.

## Analysis

### Sales Analysis

1. **Overall Sales Trend (Monthly Sales)**
   - The trend of total sales aggregated on a monthly basis is visualized to understand the overall sales pattern over time.

2. **Sales by Product Category**
   - Total sales are analyzed based on different product categories to identify which categories contribute the most to overall sales.

3. **Purchases by Gender**
   - Total sales are segmented by gender to observe any gender-based purchasing patterns.

4. **Age Distribution of Customers**
   - Distribution of customers across different age groups is visualized to understand the demographic of the customer base.

### Visualizations

Visualizations are provided for each aspect of the sales analysis, including line plots, bar plots, and regression plots to illustrate trends and relationships within the data.

### Sales Forecasting

An ARIMA model is utilized to forecast sales for the next 12 months based on historical sales data. The model parameters are determined using autocorrelation plots and AIC.

### Correlation Analysis

Correlations between certain features (age, quantity, price per unit) and total sales are calculated and visualized to understand the relationships between these variables.

## Usage
1. Ensure that the dataset path is correctly specified (`file_path` variable).
2. Run the code to generate visualizations and insights.

Feel free to adjust parameters and explore further insights from the data.
